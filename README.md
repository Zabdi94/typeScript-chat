# Chat Room

Chat Room is a simple web application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. It provides a chat interface where users can send and receive messages.

Throwback to jquery, reasons why i didnt use react were so I can have a little refresh of jQuery and basic HTML.

## Features
